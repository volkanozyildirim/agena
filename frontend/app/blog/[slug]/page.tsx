## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can **autonomously plan, execute, and adapt** to achieve complex goals with minimal human supervision. Unlike traditional AI assistants that respond to individual prompts, agentic AI systems operate as independent agents capable of multi-step reasoning, tool usage, and self-correction.

In software development, agentic AI transforms how teams build and ship code. Instead of asking an AI to "write a function," an agentic AI platform like **AGENA** takes a task from your backlog and autonomously:

1. **Analyzes the requirements** — understanding context from your codebase, past tasks, and documentation
2. **Generates production code** — writing clean, tested, and reviewable code
3. **Reviews quality** — running its own code review with a dedicated reviewer agent
4. **Creates pull requests** — pushing branches and opening PRs on GitHub or Azure DevOps

## Why Agentic AI Matters for Development Teams

Traditional development workflows are bottlenecked by human bandwidth. A typical feature goes through planning, development, code review, and deployment — each step requiring human attention and context switching.

**Agentic AI eliminates these bottlenecks** by running an autonomous pipeline:

- **PM Agent** — Breaks down tasks and prioritizes requirements
- **Developer Agent** — Writes production-grade code using your codebase context
- **Reviewer Agent** — Reviews code quality, security, and best practices
- **Finalizer Agent** — Creates branches, commits, and pull requests

This is the core of what AGENA provides — a complete **agentic AI pipeline** that turns your backlog into pull requests in minutes, not sprints.

## Agentic AI vs Traditional AI Coding Assistants

| Feature | Traditional AI Assistant | Agentic AI (AGENA) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Scope | Single prompt → single response | Full task → complete PR |
| Autonomy | Requires constant human guidance | Self-directed multi-step execution |
| Context | Limited to current conversation | Understands full codebase + history |
| Output | Code snippets | Production branches + pull requests |
| Quality | No self-review | Built-in review agent |

## How AGENA Implements Agentic AI

AGENA uses a combination of **CrewAI** for role-based agent orchestration and **LangGraph** for state machine workflow management. This dual approach provides:

- **Role specialization** — Each agent has a specific expertise area
- **Observable state transitions** — Every step is tracked and visible
- **Vector memory** — Previous task context improves future generations
- **Multi-tenant isolation** — Secure, organization-scoped execution

The result is a platform where you assign a task, and an autonomous team of AI agents delivers a ready-to-review pull request.

## Getting Started with Agentic AI

AGENA is open-source and free to start. Connect your GitHub repository, import tasks from Jira or Azure DevOps, and let the agentic AI pipeline handle the rest.

## What is Pixel Agent Technology?

Pixel agent technology is AGENA's visual orchestration layer that brings autonomous AI agents to life. Instead of abstract logs and status codes, pixel agents provide a **real-time visual representation** of your AI workforce — each agent rendered as an interactive pixel character with distinct roles and states.

## Why Visual Orchestration Matters

When you run multiple AI agents working on code generation, review, and deployment, visibility becomes critical. Teams need to know:

- **Which agents are active** and what they're working on
- **Where bottlenecks occur** in the pipeline
- **Real-time progress** of each task through the autonomous workflow
- **Historical patterns** in agent performance and task completion

Pixel agent technology solves this by providing an **office-like visual environment** where each AI agent is represented as a pixel character. You can see your PM agent analyzing requirements, your developer agent writing code, and your reviewer agent checking quality — all in real-time.

## How Pixel Agents Work in AGENA

### The Pixel Office

AGENA's dashboard features a pixel office view where agents are displayed as animated characters. Each character's state reflects the agent's current activity:

- **Seated at desk** — Agent is actively processing a task
- **Walking** — Agent is transitioning between pipeline stages
- **Idle** — Agent is available for new tasks

### Agent Roles as Visual Identities

Each pixel agent has a distinct visual identity matching their role:

- **PM Agent** — Analyzes tasks and breaks down requirements
- **Developer Agent** — Generates production code
- **Reviewer Agent** — Reviews code quality and security
- **Finalizer Agent** — Creates PRs and manages Git operations

### Real-Time State Synchronization

The pixel agent layer is synchronized with AGENA's LangGraph state machine. As the AI pipeline progresses through stages (fetch_context → analyze → generate_code → review_code → finalize), the pixel agents visually reflect each transition.

## Pixel Agent + Agentic AI = Observable Autonomy

The combination of agentic AI with pixel agent technology creates what we call **observable autonomy** — your AI agents work independently, but you always have full visibility into their progress and decision-making.

This is especially valuable for:

- **Engineering managers** monitoring AI-assisted sprint velocity
- **Team leads** tracking which tasks are being autonomously handled
- **Developers** reviewing AI-generated PRs with full context of the agent's process

## The State of AI Code Generation

AI code generation has evolved from simple autocomplete to **full autonomous development workflows**. Modern agentic AI platforms like AGENA can take a task description and produce complete, reviewable pull requests — including branch creation, code generation, quality review, and PR documentation.

## Best Practices for AI-Powered Code Generation

### 1. Provide Rich Task Context

The quality of AI-generated code directly correlates with the context provided. Best practices:

- **Write clear task descriptions** with acceptance criteria
- **Link related tasks** so the AI understands the broader feature
- **Include technical constraints** (database schema, API contracts, etc.)
- **Reference existing patterns** in your codebase

AGENA's vector memory system automatically enriches context by retrieving similar past tasks and their solutions.

### 2. Use Multi-Agent Review Pipelines

Single-agent code generation is prone to errors. AGENA's multi-agent approach ensures quality:

- **Developer Agent** generates the initial code
- **Reviewer Agent** independently reviews for bugs, security issues, and best practices
- **Finalizer Agent** creates clean commits with descriptive messages

This mirrors human development workflows but executes in minutes instead of days.

### 3. Maintain Codebase Observability

When AI agents are generating code autonomously, you need full observability:

- **Task telemetry** — Token usage, model selection, execution time per stage
- **Diff visibility** — Clear diffs showing exactly what was changed and why
- **Pipeline state tracking** — Know exactly where each task is in the workflow
- **Cost monitoring** — Track AI spend per task, sprint, and organization

### 4. Start with Well-Scoped Tasks

AI agents perform best with well-scoped, atomic tasks:

- Bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Feature implementations with defined APIs
- Refactoring tasks with specific patterns to change
- Documentation updates with clear scope

Avoid vague tasks like "improve performance" — instead, break them into specific, actionable items.

### 5. Integrate with Your Existing Workflow

AGENA integrates with your existing tools:

- **GitHub & Azure DevOps** — PR creation and branch management
- **Jira** — Task import and status synchronization
- **Slack & Teams** — Real-time notifications and ChatOps

This means AI-generated PRs go through your normal review process — your team maintains full control over what gets merged.

## The ROI of Autonomous Code Generation

Teams using AGENA's agentic AI pipeline report:

- **10x faster** first-draft delivery for routine tasks
- **Consistent code quality** across all AI-generated PRs
- **Reduced context switching** — AI handles the implementation, humans review
- **Better sprint velocity** — more tasks completed per sprint

## Why Multi-Agent Orchestration?

Single-agent AI systems hit a ceiling when tasks require multiple specialized skills. Code generation, for example, benefits from **separate agents** handling planning, implementation, review, and deployment — just like human development teams.

AGENA solves this with a dual orchestration approach:

- **CrewAI** — Defines agent roles, goals, and expertise areas
- **LangGraph** — Manages the state machine workflow between agents

## CrewAI: Role-Based Agent Teams

CrewAI enables AGENA to define specialized AI agents with distinct roles:

### PM Agent
- **Role**: Task analysis and requirement breakdown
- **Goal**: Understand the task, gather context, and create a clear implementation plan
- **Model**: Optimized for reasoning and analysis

### Developer Agent
- **Role**: Code generation
- **Goal**: Write production-grade code following codebase conventions
- **Model**: Optimized for code generation with large context windows

### Reviewer Agent
- **Role**: Code quality assurance
- **Goal**: Review generated code for bugs, security, and best practices
- **Model**: Optimized for critical analysis

### Finalizer Agent
- **Role**: Git operations and PR creation
- **Goal**: Create clean branches, commits, and pull requests
- **Model**: Optimized for structured output

## LangGraph: Observable State Machines

While CrewAI defines **who** does what, LangGraph defines **how** the work flows:

\`\`\`
fetch_context → analyze → generate_code → review_code → finalize
\`\`\`

Each node in the LangGraph DAG represents a stage with:

- **Input validation** — Ensures required context is available
- **State tracking** — Every transition is logged and observable
- **Error handling** — Automatic retry with backoff for transient failures
- **Conditional routing** — Review failures can loop back to generation

## The Power of Combining Both

CrewAI alone gives you agents but no workflow structure. LangGraph alone gives you workflows but no role specialization. Together, they provide:

| Capability | CrewAI | LangGraph | Combined |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Agent roles | Yes | No | Yes |
| State management | No | Yes | Yes |
| Observability | Limited | Full | Full |
| Error recovery | Basic | Advanced | Advanced |
| Role handoffs | Manual | Automatic | Automatic |

## Implementation in AGENA

AGENA's pipeline demonstrates this combination in production:

1. **fetch_context** — Retrieves codebase context, similar tasks from vector memory
2. **analyze** — PM agent breaks down the task into an implementation plan
3. **generate_code** — Developer agent writes code following the plan
4. **review_code** — Reviewer agent validates quality and correctness
5. **finalize** — Finalizer agent creates the PR with documentation

Each stage is a LangGraph node, and each node delegates to a CrewAI agent with the appropriate role and expertise.

    content: `
## The Challenge of Multi-Tenant AI

Building a multi-tenant AI SaaS platform presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional SaaS where tenants share the same logic, an AI platform must isolate:

- **AI agent execution** — One tenant's agents shouldn't affect another's
- **Token budgets** — Usage limits per organization
- **Vector memory** — Tenant-scoped similarity search
- **Git credentials** — Secure per-org GitHub/Azure tokens

AGENA handles all of this with a clean, async-first architecture.

## Architecture Decisions

### Organization-Scoped Everything

Every database query in AGENA is scoped by \`organization_id\`. This isn't just a filter — it's a foundational design principle:

- All SQLAlchemy models include \`organization_id\`
- API routes extract org context from JWT tokens
- Vector memory queries filter by organization
- Worker tasks are isolated per organization

### Async-First with FastAPI

AGENA's backend is fully async:

- **FastAPI** with async route handlers
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** with \`AsyncSession\`
- **Redis** async consumer for task queue
- **Async HTTP clients** for GitHub/Azure/Jira APIs

This ensures high concurrency — multiple organizations can run AI agents simultaneously without blocking.

### Redis Queue with Concurrency Control

The worker system uses Redis for task queuing with key safeguards:

- **MAX_WORKERS** — Configurable concurrent task limit
- **Queue lock guard** — Prevents same-repo concurrent execution
- **Stale job watchdog** — Auto-fails stuck tasks
- **Retry with backoff** — Handles transient LLM API failures

### Usage Enforcement and Billing

AGENA enforces per-organization limits:

- **Task quotas** — Free tier: 5 tasks/month, Pro: unlimited
- **Token tracking** — Per-task and per-org token usage counters
- **Cost allocation** — Track AI spend by task, sprint, and organization
- **Stripe + Iyzico** — Dual payment provider support

## Security Patterns

### JWT Authentication
Every API request is authenticated with JWT tokens containing:
- User ID and role
- Organization ID
- Token expiration

### Organization Isolation
Even if a user has valid credentials, they can only access data within their organization. This is enforced at the ORM level, not just the API level.

### Credential Encryption
GitHub tokens, Azure PATs, and Jira credentials are encrypted at rest and only decrypted during agent execution within the worker process.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Scope everything by org from day one** — Retrofitting multi-tenancy is painful
2. **Track AI costs per tenant** — Usage-based billing requires granular tracking
3. **Async is non-negotiable** — AI operations are I/O heavy and slow
4. **Isolate worker execution** — Queue locks prevent data corruption
5. **Observable by default** — Every AI stage should be logged and traceable

## AI Agent Nedir?

**AI Agent** (yapay zeka agentı), belirli bir hedefe ulaşmak için otonom olarak karar alabilen, planlama yapabilen ve eylem gerçekleştirebilen yapay zeka sistemidir. Basit bir chatbot'tan farklı olarak, bir AI agent:

- **Bağımsız düşünür** — Problemi analiz edip çözüm planı oluşturur
- **Araç kullanır** — API'ler, veritabanları, dosya sistemleriyle etkileşime girer
- **Kendini düzeltir** — Hata yapınca geri adım atıp farklı yaklaşım dener
- **Çok adımlı iş akışları yürütür** — Tek bir komutla karmaşık görevleri tamamlar

## Agentic AI: Agent'ların Gücü

**Agentic AI**, birden fazla AI agentının birlikte çalışarak karmaşık görevleri otonom olarak tamamlamasıdır. AGENA'da bu şu şekilde çalışır:

### Agent Rolleri

| Agent | Görev | Uzmanlık |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **PM Agent** | Görev analizi | Gereksinim anlama, plan oluşturma |
| **Developer Agent** | Kod üretimi | Production-grade kod yazma |
| **Reviewer Agent** | Kalite kontrol | Bug, güvenlik, best practice |
| **Finalizer Agent** | PR oluşturma | Branch, commit, pull request |

### Pipeline Akışı

\`\`\`
fetch_context → analyze → generate_code → review_code → finalize
\`\`\`

Her adım bir **LangGraph** state machine düğümüdür ve her düğüm bir **CrewAI** agentına delege edilir.

## AI Agent vs AI Asistan

| Özellik | AI Asistan (ChatGPT) | AI Agent (AGENA) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| Kapsam | Tek prompt → tek cevap | Tam görev → PR |

## Otonom Kodlama Nedir?

**Otonom kodlama**, yapay zeka agentlarının insan müdahalesi olmadan kod yazma, test etme, review etme ve teslim etme sürecidir. Geleneksel "autocomplete" tarzı AI yardımından temelden farklıdır — burada AI sadece öneri yapmaz, **baştan sona görevi tamamlar**.

## Otonom Kodlama vs Kod Önerileri

### GitHub Copilot Yaklaşımı
- Siz yazarsınız, AI tamamlar
- Dosya bazında çalışır
- Her satırda insan kararı gerekir
- Çıktı: kod parçacıkları

### AGENA Otonom Kodlama Yaklaşımı
- Görev tanımlarsınız, AI tamamlar
- Tüm codebase'i anlar
- İnsan sadece PR review eder
- Çıktı: branch + commit + pull request

## Otonom Kodlama Pipeline'ı

AGENA'nın otonom kodlama pipeline'ı 5 aşamadan oluşur:

\`\`\`
fetch_context → analyze → generate_code → review_code → finalize
\`\`\`

### Aşama 1: Context Toplama
Vektör bellek (Qdrant) kullanarak benzer geçmiş görevleri bulur. Codebase'den ilgili dosyaları, kalıpları ve convention'ları çıkarır.

### Aşama 2: Analiz
PM agentı görevi derinlemesine analiz eder:
- Story point tahmini
- Etkilenen dosyaların listesi
- Teknik kısıtlamalar
- Kabul kriterleri

### Aşama 3: Kod Üretimi
Developer agentı, analize dayalı olarak kod yazar:
- Mevcut kalıplara uygun kod
- Import ve dependency yönetimi
- Hata yönetimi ve edge case'ler

### Aşama 4: Otomatik Review
Reviewer agentı kodu bağımsız olarak değerlendirir:
- Fonksiyonel doğruluk
- Güvenlik taraması
- Performance analizi
- Code style uyumu

### Aşama 5: Teslim
Finalizer agentı Git işlemlerini halleder:
- Feature branch oluşturma
- Temiz commit mesajları
- PR açma ve açıklama yazma

## Otonom Kodlama İçin En İyi Pratikler

### 1. Görevleri İyi Tanımlayın
AI agentlar, net tanımlanmış görevlerde en iyi sonucu verir:
- Bug fix'lerde reproduction step'leri ekleyin
- Feature'larda acceptance criteria belirleyin
- Refactoring'de hedef pattern'i açıklayın

### 2. Codebase Convention'larını Koruyun
AGENA otomatik olarak mevcut kalıpları öğrenir, ama:
- Lint kurallarınızı güncel tutun

## AI ile Pull Request Otomasyonu

Yazılım geliştirmede en çok zaman alan süreçlerden biri **görevden PR'a giden yol**dur: görevi anlama, kodu yazma, test etme, review etme, branch açma, commit atma, PR oluşturma. **AI ile PR otomasyonu** bu sürecin tamamını dakikalara indirger.

## Geleneksel PR Süreci vs AI Otomasyonu

### Geleneksel Süreç (Saatler/Günler)
1. Görevi anlama ve planlama (~30 dk)
2. Kod yazma (~2-8 saat)
3. Self-review (~30 dk)
4. Branch oluşturma, commit (~10 dk)
5. PR açma, açıklama yazma (~15 dk)
6. Code review bekleme (~24 saat)
7. Revision'lar (~1-4 saat)

**Toplam: 1-3 gün**

### AGENA AI Otomasyonu (Dakikalar)
1. Görev seçimi (1 dk — backlog'dan seç)
2. AI analiz + planlama (~2 dk)
3. AI kod üretimi (~3-5 dk)
4. AI code review (~2 dk)
5. Otomatik branch + commit + PR (~1 dk)

**Toplam: ~10 dakika**

## AGENA ile PR Otomasyonu Nasıl Çalışır?

### Adım 1: Görev İmport
Görevlerinizi üç kaynaktan alabilirsiniz:
- **Azure DevOps** — Sprint'ten iş öğelerini seçin
- **Jira** — Board'dan task'ları import edin
- **Manuel** — Doğrudan AGENA'da görev oluşturun

### Adım 2: AI Pipeline Başlatma
Görevi seçip "Assign to AI" dediğinizde pipeline başlar:

\`\`\`
PM Agent → Planner Agent → Developer Agent → Reviewer Agent → Finalizer
\`\`\`

Her aşamayı pixel agent dashboard'undan gerçek zamanlı izleyebilirsiniz.

### Adım 3: Otomatik PR Oluşturma
Pipeline tamamlandığında AGENA otomatik olarak:
- **Feature branch** oluşturur (ör. \`feature/TASK-123-user-auth\`)
- **Clean commit'ler** atar (anlamlı mesajlarla)
- **PR açar** (başlık, açıklama, dosya listesi ile)
- **Reviewer atar** (ayarlıysa)

### Adım 4: İnsan Review
Siz sadece PR'ı review edersiniz:
- AI'ın ürettiği kodu inceleyin
- Gerekirse yorum bırakın
- Merge edin

## Desteklenen Platformlar

| Platform | Özellikler |
|----------|-----------|
| **GitHub** | Branch, commit, PR, reviewer atama, label |
| **Azure DevOps** | Branch, PR, work item güncelleme, reviewer |

## PR Otomasyonunun Faydaları

### Sprint Velocity Artışı
Rutin görevler (bug fix, küçük feature, refactoring) AI tarafından dakikalar içinde PR'a dönüşür. Ekip büyük, yaratıcı görevlere odaklanır.

### Tutarlı PR Kalitesi
Her PR aynı standartta:
- Açıklayıcı başlık ve description
- Clean diff, gereksiz değişiklik yok
- AI reviewer tarafından önceden kontrol edilmiş

### 7/24 Çalışma
AI agentlar uyumaz. Gece oluşturulan görevler sabaha PR olarak hazırdır.

### DORA Metrikleri İyileşmesi
- **Lead Time** azalır — görevden PR'a süre dakikalara iner
- **Deployment Frequency** artar — daha fazla PR, daha sık deploy
- **Change Failure Rate** düşer — AI review kaliteyi artırır

## Flow Builder ile Gelişmiş Otomasyon

AGENA'nın visual flow builder'ı ile daha karmaşık senaryolar oluşturabilirsiniz:

- **Sprint başında**: Tüm "New" durumundaki görevleri otomatik import et
- **PR açıldığında**: Slack'e bildirim gönder
- **Review tamamlandığında**: Azure DevOps work item'ı "Done"a çek
- **Koşullu akışlar**: Story point'e göre farklı model kullan

## Başlayın

AGENA ile ilk otomatik PR'ınızı dakikalar içinde oluşturun:

1. [Ücretsiz kaydolun](/signup)
2. GitHub veya Azure DevOps reponuzu bağlayın

## AGENA vs GitHub Copilot: A Different Approach to AI Coding

GitHub Copilot and AGENA both use AI to help developers write code, but they represent fundamentally different paradigms:

- **Copilot** = AI-assisted coding (human drives, AI suggests)
- **AGENA** = Agentic AI coding (AI drives, human reviews)

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | AGENA |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Approach** | Autocomplete suggestions | Full task-to-PR autonomy |
| **Scope** | Current file/line | Entire codebase |
| **Output** | Code snippets | Complete pull requests |
| **Review** | None (human reviews manually) | Built-in AI reviewer agent |
| **Context** | Open files in IDE | Full repo + vector memory + past tasks |
| **Multi-file** | Limited | Yes, cross-file changes |
| **Git operations** | None | Branch, commit, PR creation |
| **Pipeline** | None | PM → Developer → Reviewer → Finalizer |
| **Self-hosted** | No | Yes, open-source |
| **Multi-tenant** | No | Yes, organization isolation |
| **Integrations** | IDE only | GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jira, Slack, Teams |

## When to Use Copilot

Copilot excels at:
- **In-editor suggestions** while you type
- **Quick function completions** for routine patterns
- **Learning new APIs** through inline examples
- **Real-time pair programming** experience

## When to Use AGENA

AGENA excels at:
- **Batch task processing** — Queue 10 tasks, get 10 PRs
- **Autonomous delivery** — No manual coding needed for routine tasks
- **Team-wide automation** — Multiple developers benefit from shared AI agents
- **Full pipeline** — From task analysis to PR creation
- **Code review** — Built-in quality assurance before PR
- **Observability** — Pixel agent dashboard shows AI workflow progress
- **Self-hosting** — Complete control over your AI infrastructure

## Using Both Together

AGENA and Copilot are complementary:

1. **Use Copilot** for complex, creative coding where you want AI assistance while you think
2. **Use AGENA** for well-defined tasks that can be fully automated (bug fixes, feature implementations, refactoring)

This way, your team gets:
- **IDE-level AI** from Copilot for hands-on work
- **Pipeline-level AI** from AGENA for autonomous delivery

## The Agentic AI Advantage

The key difference is **autonomy**. Copilot waits for you to type. AGENA takes a task and delivers a PR. This is the shift from AI-assisted to **agentic AI** — and it represents the future of software development.
